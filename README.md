# SQL-Project-1-dvdrental-Database-Analysis
First part of my SQL project using the dvdrental database from my course. Applied commands from the first module — SELECT, WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE — aiming not just to write queries, but to think like an analyst turning data into insights.
